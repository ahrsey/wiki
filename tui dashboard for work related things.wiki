A dashboard like https://wtfutil.com/modules/clocks/ 

Thought it might be a good time to test out
https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea and learn golang.

I can build integrations for jira and pr's etc

This could also be used to monitor wifi and other things like that and music
and other things I don't want ot use from the gui
