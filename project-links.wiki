I want to be able to have groups of links for each ticket/job that I can select
from based on the work I'm doing.

= Example =

If I'm working on a ticket about X, then I can store files related to X which I
can rerun and open automatically as vim buffers.

= Thoughts =

It shouldn't be hard to create scripts with some `rg`, but `where would I store
these?` 

Maybe I could `tag` searches. `search cdk` will return all cdk related
assets, or `search v2` for settlement-v2, or `search infrastructure`

Currently what I'm thinking is it might be cool to be able to tag certain files and store them for later retrival

= Concept =

Store/add files to named `tag`
`rg 'tag' --files | search tag`

Edit files in `tag`. Displays files in tag for removal?
`search tag --edit`

Open saved files in vim
`search tag | vim`
