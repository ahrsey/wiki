Application will take an array of text.

Each text item will be rendered an equal distance on a globe that simulates gravity. 

Camera will start on first section of text and will on zoom move the camera and
rotate the globe to create the affect of moving towards next section of text
through the air.

And that's it.

Was thinking to do first examples with three.js because that'll be easier.
