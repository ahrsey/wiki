@smilingbig i just export a playlist and put the link in a list and have yt-dlp pull the lists, so i can listen/watch while "not online"

I think all I'd need is what videos I've watched and something to keep track of where I am in a video,

but who cares I guess, I was thinking of just building something small to keep track of what youtube videos I've watched and let me download them hmm not sure if I can download without an account

@shaterpalette: bard is honestly pretty good at searching YT for you

- an ai based way to search youtube for discovery
- way to download youtube videos
- record watched videos
