== Single responsibility principle ==

A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class
should have only one job.



== Open-closed Principle (OCP) ==

Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

-

1. They are “Open For Extension”.
This means that the behavior of the module can be extended. That we can make
the module behave in new and different ways as the requirements of the application
change, or to meet the needs of new applications.

2. They are “Closed for Modification”.
The source code of such a module is inviolate. No one is allowed to make source
code changes to it.

== Liskov Substitution Principle ==

Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y)
should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.

I had some trouble understanding this one. It looks like the reason for it is
to create better class inheritance base classes.

I found a few articles about this concept and most of them just refactor the base
class to be more generic and then extend that with more detailed class types.
