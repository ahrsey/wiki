I currently can't use code actions to install npm packages automatically. Maybe
something cool to build to learn how to make nvim plugins

Not sure if this is possible, but I guess I would need to look into extending
the language server currently running (TSServer I guess) and hook into the code
actions call to recognise package paths, read them and find the package.json
related to them and install it async
