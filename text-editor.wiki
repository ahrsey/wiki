so I was thinking what I want to do is make an editor that makes it easy to
select things, using similar to vim shortcuts but with easier ways.

Using more f so the idea would be to use f to enter find and then the letter
you want to match and then each of those letters becomes numbered and you
select a number.

Something along those lines and when you do a selection it should have a way to
select more until a point and then run a command on the selection.

There will be a background server waiting for selections to be sent to it to
run commands, which will be cli commands. And you can write other matchers that
can be run on selections I want to see how fast I can build this and how well
it'll perform.
