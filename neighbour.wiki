Infect neighbours style strategy game.

Concept
You're some sort of creature trying to infect your neighbours to take over the
neighbour hood. I thought it might be cool to have some mechanics where you
have to befriend neighbours via different techniques depending ont he neighbour
to get into their homes to infect them.

It'd be cool if each neighbour had a specfic, complicated way to play the game.
For example each character has a specific house design and people who live in
the house with different ways to enter the house.
