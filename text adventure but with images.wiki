ui map of city with a puzzle and you have to visit different places to finish
the game and solve mystery.

stats based on things you find that unlock things, and multi different state
directions to solve things differently.

Fully state based aventure game

Might be interesting to just implement something that reads the states. That
way I can build a thing that I can just load into the game anytimes and also
build the story separately.
