Was thinking of creating something that can use normal lambdas, sqs, sns etc
and visualise execution to allow for graph layouts that step functions provide,
logging, and easy viewing of logs etc but also look into other step function
functionality like parallel exections and look into creating some aws libs to
extend gui interfaces with step function like functionality
