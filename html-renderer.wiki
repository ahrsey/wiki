Js html renderer for server and client

html structure without an intermediat structure just directly in js, arrays and objects.

`render(html)` = html structure

```js
const client = render(html, server_requested_api_data)
const html = [other_html_structure, client]
const server = render(html, client_requested_api_data)
```

You'd manually structure which parts to client render and which to server render.

The client rendered part would need to be delivered with the frontend as js,
but maybe that could simply be a manual process with an assert.
