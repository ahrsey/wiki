application launcher from terminal that supports launching any application in
Applications

should also allow `define` style dictionary look ups, maths and other easy
bindings for easy launching of sub tasks. Like for example launching tmux in
sub folder structures or automatically opening tmux session for work directory

also will need a way to find a shortcut to open terminal by pressing command +
space, spotlight style

Was thinking to build this in golang

Could use something like this
