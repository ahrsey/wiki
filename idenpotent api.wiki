Build an http service for automatically creating idempotent requests using
hashes. It would also be good if there was a time stamp that we could use for
an acceptable range of time to wait before making another call with the same
data and url

Some things to read about how unique crytographic hashes are
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3060259/do-cryptographic-hashes-provide-really-unique-results
- https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/63339/how-do-hashes-really-ensure-uniqueness
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function
- https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/58214/how-can-hashes-be-unique-if-they-are-limited-in-number

Also would be good to look into other options for idempotent implementaions.
- etags?
- endpoint for returning unique key?
- and research other solutions
