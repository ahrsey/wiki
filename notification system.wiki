= Notification system concept =

%% Going to build this in golang and the idea is just to integrate with things I
%% use at work and display notifications from things like MR's in gitlab, jira
%% updates on tickets assigned to me and things like that.

Notification aggregator

Take some endpoint/api (and maybe a tiny amount of config/boilerplate code, leaning
towards config atm), and then grab notifications for that and display them as a
tui app.

Decided to build this in rust rather, just for fun.

- Api integrations jira, gitlab, (slack? email?)
- Setup a way to include more integrations easily
- Notification formatting options
- Display/layout options

Going to do a retake on this one actually, instead let's try and do this in
node and distrube on npm, with typescript. But only use standard libs as far as
I can.

= Potential app structure =

- Notification
  TUI view command, send updates to this to be displayed, something like that
  To display -> `There is a notification here and here's the link`

- Commands
  CRUD and other generic commands to use on different apis, fetch updates on
  mr/pr, fetch comments on story tickets related to current user, fetch
  emails with certain filters, fetch slack DM's

- Integration
  Different api's to be used by commands

- Config
  JSON for setup of api authentication requirements and which notifications to
  query etc
