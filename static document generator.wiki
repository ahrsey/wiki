== basic markdown parser ==

Implement basic markdown parser, starting with only a single element as a
platform for other additions later

== routes to html pages ==

File based structure generation, the following structure should create an html
page at do.main/page.html

└── pages
			└── page.md

== shared values piped into html pages ==
Need a way to store global values shared across pages generated, like site
title or metadata.

But instead of doing this we could simply have static html page that has the
values hardcoded that wrap the other pages.

Maybe I can use the scaffolding functionality to create reusable parts 

== generator / scaffolder for generating common structures ==
I had this idea to create kind of generators for common components.

create page generator
- generates the structure specified for a new markdown page with defaults prefilled

This would be the basic concept, but I was thinking this could also be used to
create other generic structures that are referenced inside the markdown pages
or layout pages.

TODO
- md to html
- wrap html generated with general layout
